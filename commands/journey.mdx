## Overview
The `/journey` command allows you to plan a journey using London's public transport system. It provides detailed information about the route, including the lines used, changes required, and estimated travel time.

<Info>
  This command provides journey planning for any location in the UK, not just London. However, it is recommended to use station names or well-known landmarks and use only for journeys that start and end in the London area.

<Tip>
  Use the autocomplete options to provide the most accurate origin and destination for your journey.
