The `/locatebus` command allows you to find the current route and location of a specific bus in London. It provides real-time information about the bus's route and the next stop.
<Note>
  If the bus is not currently in service, LondonTransit will be told that the bus's information is not available.

- **Route and Direction**: The bus route number and the direction it is heading.
- **Next Stop**: The next stop the bus will make.
