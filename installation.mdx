To add LondonTransit to your Discord server, follow these steps:

3. Once signed in to Discord's OAuth page, **select "Add to Server"**, then choose the server you want to add LondonTransit to from the dropdown menu.
   - If you do not see your server, ensure you have the "Manage Server" permission in that server.
   - If you are not an administrator, you will need to ask an admin to add the bot for you.
4. **Authorize the bot** by clicking "Authorize" and completing the CAPTCHA if prompted.
5. Start exploring LondonTransit!

# User Installation
<Info>
  Installing to your user account allows you to use LondonTransit anywhere on Discord, and does not give the bot permissions more than it would in a server or to manage your account.\
  \
  In servers with more than 25 members, the bot will reply ephemerally if it is not added to the server. This limit is set by Discord.
