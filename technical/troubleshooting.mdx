# Frequent Issues and Solutions
This section addresses common issues users may encounter while using LondonTransit and provides solutions to resolve them.

## Bot Not Responding
If the bot fails to respond to commands, try the following steps:
1. **Check your input**: If LondonTransit can't find a valid response to a provided input, there is a small chance it will not respond at all. Ensure your command is correctly formatted and the parameters are valid.
2. **Check permissions**: Ensure that the bot has the necessary permissions in the server to read messages and send responses.
3. **Check bot status**: Sometimes, the bot may be temporarily offline for maintenance or updates. Check the [LondonTransit status page](https://status.mbfrias.com) for any ongoing issues.

## Command Not Found
If you receive a "Command not found" error, it may be due to one of the following reasons:
1. **Outdated Discord cache**: LondonTransit may have been recently updated, with commands changed. Such changes may not take immediate effect on your Discord client. To resolve this, reboot your Discord client or clear the cache.

## Invalid Parameters
If you receive an error indicating that the parameters provided are invalid:
1. **Check your input**: You may have entered non-existent or misspelled places or other parameters. Ensure that the parameters you are using are valid and correctly spelled.
2. **Use autocomplete**: When available, use the autocomplete feature to select valid options for parameters.

## Other Issues
If you encounter any other issues not covered here, consider the following:
1. **Check the documentation**: Review the [LondonTransit documentation](https://londontransit.org.uk/docs) for guidance on using commands and features.
2. **Contact support**: If you are still experiencing issues, you can reach out to the [developer's contact page](https://www.md3v.co.uk/contact) for assistance. Provide as much detail as possible about the issue you are facing, including any error messages or unexpected behavior.
